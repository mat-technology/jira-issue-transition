# Jira Transition
Transition Jira issue


This action is based on code from https://github.com/atlassian/gajira-transition and was forked to add these features:

* support for multiple issues

## Usage

> ##### Note: this action requires [Jira Login Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jira-login)

  id: transition
  uses: mat-technology/jira-issue-transition@master
  with:
    issues: RPR-181
